Node.js Application Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm
This guide provides a high-level overview of deploying a Node.js application using Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. It covers the entire process from containerization to deploying to a Kubernetes cluster and managing the application with Helm.

Prerequisites
Docker: Install Docker to containerize your Node.js application.

Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster. Options include Minikube for local development or cloud-managed Kubernetes services (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS).

Helm: Install Helm, a Kubernetes package manager.

Deployment Steps
Step 1: Dockerize Your Node.js Application
Create a Dockerfile in your Node.js project directory to define your Docker image.
Build the Docker image.
Optionally, push the Docker image to a container registry.

Step 2: Deploying to Kubernetes
Create Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML files to define your application's deployment and service.
Apply the Deployment and Service to your Kubernetes cluster.

Step 3: Helm Chart for Application Management

Create a Helm chart structure and define configurable values in a values.yaml file.
Create templates for Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources.
Package the Helm chart.
Install the Helm chart to manage your application in Kubernetes.
Customization
Customize Helm values in the values.yaml file for your specific application.

Implement tests (e.g., using Mocha and Chai) to ensure application correctness.

Please replace placeholders (your-docker-image-name, tag, your-domain.com, etc.) with your specific configurations and details.
